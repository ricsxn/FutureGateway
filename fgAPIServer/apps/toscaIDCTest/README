Demo application executing TOSCA IDC  
TOSCA IDC interface test, bypasses the JSAGA adaptor contating directly the TOSCA endpoint
TOSCA template file tosca_template.yaml, has been taken from official templates repository from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigo-dc/tosca-templates/master/amber/ambertools.yaml

To execute the demo, please follow the steps below(*):

1) Prepare the job submission (assuming that TOSCA IDC app has id 3)
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"application":"3","description":"TOSCAIDC test run", "arguments": []}' http://localhost:8888/v1.0/tasks
Inside the json returned by the command, keep note of the "id" value that will be used by the next command

2) Finalize the execution instructing the API server daemon to submit (assuming that task id returned by the previous command is 6)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8888/v1.0/tasks/6/input
The "gestatus" value equal to "triggered" informs that the daemon is now in charge of submitting the job

(*) CURL_AUTH variable contains authirization token. It could be empty or contain:

    session token: CURL_AUTH="-H \"Authorization: $STOKEN\""  
    PTV token    : CURL_AUTH="-H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\""
