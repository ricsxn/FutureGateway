Demo application executing ENES ophidia client

To execute the demo, please follow the steps below:

1) Prepare the job submission
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"application":"3","description":"ophidia test run", "arguments": [],  "output_files": [{"name":"out.png"}], "input_files": []}' http://localhost:8888/v1.0/tasks?user=brunor
Inside the json returned by the command, keep note of the "id" value that will be used by the next command

2) Finalize the execution instructing the API server daemon to submit
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8888/v1.0/tasks/6/input?user=brunor
The "gestatus" value equal to "triggered" informs that the daemon is now in charge of submitting the job
